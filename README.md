### 🌌 About Me  
`👐`  *"Every piece of software is just a puzzle made by humans—and if it’s made by humans, it can be cracked by humans. Nothing is truly unbreakable, just undiscovered."*

`🪐` **Who Am I?**  
`⭐` 21 y/o software Developer, Video Editor and Graphics Designer  
`🔧` Personally named as builder of tools and things no one asked for, but everyone needed.  

`🎯` **Passions:**  
- `🧩` Cracking puzzles (digital or life).  
- `⚙️` Building systems that don't just work—they thrive.  
- `🔍` Exploring tech like it owes me answers.  

`🎨` **What I’m Up To:**  
- `🚀` Developing dope software you’ve probably never heard of.  
- `🤓` Experimenting with weird ideas.  
- `☕` Balancing 3 cups of coffee and infinite debugging sessions.  

`📯`  **Let’s Build Together:**  
`👜`  *Partnership? Contact me on Discord:* `kamerzystanasyt_`  

## `🧩`  Fun Fact:
`🍀`  *Sometimes I code to escape life. Other times, life escapes while I code.*
